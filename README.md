# Ethereum-price-prediction
AI-driven web application that forecasts Ethereum (ETH) prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The project features a Flask backend that fetches historical price data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it, and uses a pre-trained LSTM model to predict future prices. A React frontend consumes the backend API to display real-time predictions in a modern, responsive UI.
